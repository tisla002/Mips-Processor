# Mips-Processor
This project was intended to demonstrate some of my understanding and usage of the Verilog language.

I have implemented a Single-Cycle MIPS processor with forwarding enabled. I used Verilog for implementation and tested my implementation using a Verilog Test Bench. This implemenation includes an ALU, PC, Registers, and Memory. 

It supports several commands: 
* add, addu, addi 
* sub, subi 
* slt 
* nor, or
* and 
* lw, sw
* beq
